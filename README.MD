# Попытка в аналог Quizlet

I am using Python Flask for basic Anki-Quizlet alternative just
for home use. 

Main ideas i want to implement:

- latex support (done)
- Scheduler (FSRS for example)
- Error propagation on similar cards (Build embeddings of cards and have space of vectors)
- Different card revision ways (As in Quizlet)
